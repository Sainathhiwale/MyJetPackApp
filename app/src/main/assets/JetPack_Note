create the jetpack compose project
1. select file anc click new project.
2. select the empty compose activity
3. give the app name.
4. Select the build configuration language, like Kotlin DSL gradle.kts

after created the project the set android compileSdk version as 34 if you faced the metadata issue.

to Check the kotlin version and compatibility we need to create the module how to create
1. click on app folder select module
2. give the module name as Test or any you like to give.
3. created class make main function and run the hello world program.
4. check compiler successfully display hello world on console.

# Task Create the Card view on screen
1.create CreateBizCard method with @Composable annotation.
2. take surface UI component to display the screen
  surface: In Jetpack Compose, a Surface is a fundamental building block for creating and styling UI elements.
  It acts as a container that defines the visual appearance and behavior of its content.
  syntax: Surface(
               modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), // Fills the entire screen
               color = Color.LightGray, // Sets the background color
               shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp), // Defines rounded corners
               elevation = 4.dp // Adds a slight shadow for depth
           ) {
               Text(text = "Hello, Jetpack Compose!", modifier = Padding(16.dp)) // Content within the Surface
           }
#.What is compose?
 Jetpack Compose is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI
 development on Android. It is a part of the Jetpack suite of libraries.

#Why we need Compose?
 1. It’s Declarative
 Jetpack Compose is a declarative UI framework, which means you describe your view without relying on mutation and more traditional imperative programming concepts.

 2. It’s Independent
 Compose is a library that isn’t coupled to the operating system. This is a major advantage for developers.

 3. Less and reusable code
 The Compose library is built in such a way that you can build up your UI in small, reusable building blocks rather than at the Fragment or Activity level. That composability increases code reuse and clarity.

 4. Interoperable
 Compose is built to interoperate with your existing app. You can embed compose UIs within Views or Views within Compose. You can add as little as a single button to a screen, or keep that custom view you’ve created in a now Compose screen.

 5. Jetpack Integration
 Compose is built to integrate with the Jetpack libraries you already know and love. With integration with Navigation, Paging, LiveData (or Flow/RxJava), ViewModel and Hilt, compose works with your existing architecture

 6. 100% Kotlin
 written in Kotlin programming language

 7. One codebase
 No need to write XML anymore.
 # Imperative programming vs Declarative programming
   Imperative UI
   This is the most common paradigm. It involves having a separate prototype/model of the application’s UI. This design focuses on the how rather than the what. A good example is XML layouts in Android. We design the widgets and components which are then rendered for the user to see and interact with.

   Imperative UI sample code:

   Xml:

      <TextView
           android:id="@+id/tv_name"
           android:layout_width="match_parent"
           android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        />
   Java:

   public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

       TextView tvName;
       @Override
       protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           setContentView(R.layout.activity_checkbox);
           tvName = findViewById(R.id.tv_name);
           tvName.setText("Hello World");
       }
   }

   Declarative UI
   This pattern is an emerging trend that allows the developers to design the user interface based on the data received. This on the other hand focuses on the what. This design paradigm makes use of one programming language to create an entire application.


   class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
       override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
           setContent {
               Text(text = "Hello World")
           }
       }
   }

   Advantages of JetPack Compose
   It is very fast and offers a smooth performance.
   It’s simple to learn.
   It is possible to interoperate with an imperative approach.
   Offers a better way to implement loose coupling principles.
   It is 100% made in Kotlin which makes it a modern approach in Android development.

 #How to show the screen layout and ui in jetpack compose project

  @Preview is jetpack annotation which is use to show the ui preview in android studio ui screen.

  example:
  @Preview(showBackground = true, showSystemUi = true)

  showSystemUi: showSystemUi is a parameter in Jetpack Compose's Window class, used to control
  the system UI visibility in an Android app. It allows you to customize how the system UI
   (such as the status bar and navigation bar) behaves within your Compose-based application.
